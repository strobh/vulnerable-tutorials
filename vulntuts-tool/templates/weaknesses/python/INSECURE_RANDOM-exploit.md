The random functions in the `random` module are so-called **pseudo-random number generators** that are not cryptographically secure. That means that the generated number sequence is not truly random, because it is completely determined by an initial value (called `seed`).

An attacker may be able to guess the seed (e.g., if the seed is set to a predictable value or if the seed is based on the current timestamp) or determine the seed (e.g., if he has observed several random numbers that were produced by these functions). If the attacker knows the seed, this allows him to **predict the output of the random functions**.

Therefore, these functions should **never be used for security-related tasks** such as cryptography, generating random passwords, or generating salts.
