If a software stores passwords in clear text, there is a risk that an attacker can gain access to them.
This may be an employee or developer who has access to the database and thus to all usernames and passwords. However, it may also be an external attacker who has gained access to the database by hacking into the system.

The attacker can then use the compromised list of passwords in various ways.
First, the attacker can **log in to the software as the corresponding user** and thus cause damage or access the user's personal data.
Second, since many users use the same password across multiple services, the attacker may also **gain access to the user's accounts on other websites**.
Third, the attacker can **sell or publish the list of usernames/emails and passwords**, allowing others to gain access to the accounts.
