The application stores a file with sensitive data under the web document root with insufficient access control.
An attacker may simply open and read this file in the browser (e.g. `www.example.org/some_sensitive_file.txt`) and gain access to the sensitive information contained in the file.

Files with potentially sensitive contents are, for example, configuration files (e.g., with a database password), log files (e.g., if credentials or error messages are logged), or git repositories (allows access to the source code).
