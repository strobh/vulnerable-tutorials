If a client-server application validates input only on the client side, but not on the server side, an attacker may be able to **bypass the validation and send invalid or malicious data to the server**.

A common example are web pages where the input in a form is validated with JavaScript before the data is sent to the server.
However, this validation can be bypassed very easily: An attacker may disable the execution of JavaScript in his browser or send the data manually via another tool that does not validate the data.

Another example are client applications that communicate with a server, such as smartphone apps or Java desktop applications. An attacker can figure out the interface to the server and manually send malicious data that has not been validated.

The consequences of the attack vary depending on what the validation is trying to protect. Due to the missing validation, far-reaching attacks may be possible in some cases.
