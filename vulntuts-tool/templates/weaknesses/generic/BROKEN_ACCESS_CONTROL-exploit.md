Let's assume a website has an administration interface that is accessible at `https://www.example.com/admin.php`.
An attacker could guess this URL without knowing the URL beforehand or he could find a link to the admin page on the website. Then the attacker could open the URL of the admin interface in the browser. If the server does not verify whether the user is really logged in and is the administrator, the attacker may **gain access to sensitive information**, **cause damage**, or **be able to take over the website**.

Another example is editing a post in a forum. The server should always check whether the requesting user is logged in and if it is his post that he wants to edit. Otherwise, an attacker could be able to edit another user's posts.
