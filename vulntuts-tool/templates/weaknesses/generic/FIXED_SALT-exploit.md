If a software stores password hashes, there is a risk that an attacker can gain access to them.
This may be an employee or developer who has access to the database and thus to all usernames and password hashes. However, it may also be an external attacker who has gained access to the database by hacking into the system.

An attacker who has gained access to the list of password hashes typically uses a **brute-force attack** to crack the password hashes. The attacker generates millions of possible passwords, calculates the hashes of them, and hopes that he finds the correct hash (and thus the corresponding password). This is simplified by the fact that many users have bad passwords that can be found in lists of common passwords (e.g., from previous password breaches on other platforms). Thus, an attacker first calculates the hashes of known passwords in his brute-force attack. These bad passwords are, therefore, cracked very quickly.

Another problem is that all users who have the same password also have the same password hash. If an attacker finds the password to a hash, he **knows the password for all users with this password hash**.
Salts are hashed together with the password to prevent this. However, if the same static salt is used for every user, the same password results in the same password hash again. Thus, the attacker can calculate hashes and guess passwords for all users at the same time. **Using a static instead of a random salt reduces the amount of effort an attacker must spend to crack the password hashes considerably.**

Example: The attacker tries to guess the password for the hash `ed35b25ffc18b8960553f7d846f0fb90` with the static salt `staticsalt` and tries common passwords first:

```
admin       + staticsalt  --->  8b35ab95c9228d169430b1d8e8ae6b2b (not correct)
test123     + staticsalt  --->  dfd74a1e785b06658475108c20708f00 (not correct)
password123 + staticsalt  --->  ed35b25ffc18b8960553f7d846f0fb90 (correct password found)
```

To prevent this, the hashing algorithm must be used in a way such that **different users who have the same password do not get the same hash**. For this purpose, a **random** string (called `salt`) that is different for each user is added to the password before it is hashed (see next section on how to fix the vulnerability).

If the attacker managed to find out some passwords, he can then use the list of passwords in various ways.
First, the attacker can **log in to the software as the corresponding user** and thus cause damage or access the user's personal data.
Second, since many users use the same password across multiple services, the attacker may also **gain access to the user's accounts on other websites**.
Third, the attacker can **sell or publish the list of usernames/emails and passwords**, allowing others to gain access to the accounts.
