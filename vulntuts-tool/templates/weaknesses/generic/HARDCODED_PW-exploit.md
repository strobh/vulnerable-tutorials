If the username and password to log into an application are hard-coded into the software, there is a risk that an attacker may gain access to these credentials. The attacker would then be able to log into the software and cause damage.

There are many ways an attacker can obtain hard-coded credentials:

- If the source code is publicly available (e.g., on GitHub or as software download), an attacker can find the username and password in the source code and log into the application.
- If the software has been compiled and published (e.g. as iOS app, Android app, or `jar` file for Java applications), an attacker can decompile the software and find the credentials in it.
- If there are several installations of the software (i.e., the software is used by several people/organizations), the password is the same for each installation. A user who knows the password of one installation can also log in to another installation (of another organization). This problem also exists with default passwords that are the same in every installation.
- The password is known to employees or software developers who disclose it to an attacker.
- And many more ...
