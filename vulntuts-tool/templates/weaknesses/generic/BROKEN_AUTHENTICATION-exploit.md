Authentication is the process of verifying that an individual is whom it claims to be. Authentication in the context of web applications is commonly performed by submitting a username/email and one or more items of private information such as a password that only a given user should know.
If the authentication mechanism is weak/insecure, this may allow an attacker to **impersonate another user and log in as that user**.

Since there are many ways in which the authentication mechanism can be implemented weakly, only a small selection can be presented here:

- If the software allows a user to use passwords that are shorter than 8 characters, an attacker may be able to guess the password.
- If the software does not throttle the rate of authentication attempts, an attacker is allowed to try many different passwords until he possibly finds the correct one.
- If the password is transmitted over an unencrypted connection, an attacker could eavesdrop on the connection and thus obtain the password.
- If the software uses multi-factor authentication but implements it weakly, the attacker may be able to bypass one of the factors, reducing the security of the authentication process.
