If the software contains a mechanism for users to recover or change their passwords that is weak/insecure, this may allow an attacker to **change the password of another user and gain access to that user's account**.

Typically, the `forgot password` mechanism works as follows:
First, a user enters his e-mail address with which he registered on the website.
In order to verify that the user who wants to change the password is really the user he claims to be, a random code is sent to the email address. The assumption for this is that only the real user should have access to the email account.
The user must enter the code from the email on the website or click on a link that contains this code as URL parameter.
Finally, the server validates the code and lets the user set a new password.

There are a few ways in which this mechanism can be implemented weakly:

- If the code sent in the email is easy to guess or is calculated using a deterministic algorithm, the attacker can guess or calculate the code without needing access to the email account of the user.
- An attacker may be allowed to try many different codes on the server until he finds the correct one.
- If the software uses weak recovery questions to verify the user's identity, an attacker may be able to guess the correct answer and reset the password.
- If the software automatically generates a new password and sends it by email, an email server may be able to read the content of the email on the way to the recipient since emails are not encrypted.
- If the software immediately blocks access to the account, e.g., because the password is changed, an attacker can lock out the real user, as he will no longer be able to log into his account with the original password.
