If a software uses a cryptography algorithm that is considered insecure or broken, this might allow an attacker to **break the algorithm and gain access to sensitive information**.

The following overview offers only a selection of relevant attack scenarios against cryptography algorithms and cannot provide detailed information about all possible attacks. However, some detailed explanations are linked in the list below.

#### Encryption algorithms

There are several encryption algorithms or encryption modes that are considered to be insecure or cryptographically broken.

- `AES` encryption in `CBC` mode is considered insecure under certain conditions. It may be susceptible to [bit-flipping attacks](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/66086), which allow an attacker to manipulate bits of the decrypted message in a targeted manner, and [padding oracle attacks](https://robertheaton.com/2013/07/29/padding-oracle-attack/), which allow an attacker to decrypt the message. In general, `CBC` provides confidentiality, but no authenticity or integrity (i.e., an attacker can manipulate the cipher text without the receiver noticing it). The widespread consensus, therefore, is that the use of `CBC` without a Message Authentication Code (MAC), which provides authenticity and integrity, is undesirable.
- The `ECB` encryption mode is considered to be insecure, regardless of which encryption algorithm (such as `AES`) is used. [The same block of plaintext always yields the same ciphertext](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/20946). This allows an attacker to gain knowledge, e.g., about patterns in the data, or whether the same message is sent again or another one.
- `RSA` encryption without a padding has the same problems as the `ECB` mode: The same block of plaintext always yields the same ciphertext, thus leaking sensitive information.
- `RSA` encryption with the `PKCS#1 v1.5` padding is considered insecure as it is vulnerable to the [Bleichenbacher's attack](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/12706). In this attack, the attacker sends a large number of ciphertexts to be decrypted which are chosen adaptively. This allows the attacker to gradually reveal information about an encrypted message, or about the decryption key itself.
- The `DES` encryption algorithm uses a relatively short 56-bit key size. [There are systems](https://crack.sh/) that are able to break a DES key within less than 24 hours by using a brute-force attack.
- `Triple DES`/`3DES`/`TDES`/`TDEA` is a more secure triple key version of DES. But even though it has a larger key size, it is [already considered insecure](https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2017/Update-to-Current-Use-and-Deprecation-of-TDEA) in the face of modern super-computing power.
- The `RC4`/`ARC4`/`ARCFOUR` encryption algorithm is susceptible to a [range of attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4#Security) and is, therefore, also insecure.

Another common mistake is the incorrect use of encryption algorithms:

- If the `initialization vector (IV)` for the `CBC` encryption mode is always the same instead of randomly generated, this might leak sensitive information to an attacker. First, the same block of plaintext always yields the same ciphertext. Second, if the beginning of two plaintexts are the same and they differ in the middle, the attacker can find out at which point they differ and thus possibly find out sensitive information as well. Third, if the attacker is allowed to encrypt his own plaintexts, he may be able deduce the value of low entropy plaintext blocks.
- If the `encryption key` can be guessed easily, an attacker may be able to figure out the key by trying potential keys.

#### Hash/Message digest algorithms

The hash functions `sha1` and `md5` are considered cryptographically broken.
There are **collision attacks** for both of these hash algorithms. This means that an attacker is able to find two inputs whose hashes are the same.
For `md5`, the attack can find collisions within seconds which makes `md5` completely unsuitable for further use.
