If a software stores password hashes, there is a risk that an attacker can gain access to them.
This may be an employee or developer who has access to the database and thus to all usernames and password hashes. However, it may also be an external attacker who has gained access to the database by hacking into the system.

An attacker who has gained access to the list of password hashes typically uses a **brute-force attack** to crack the password hashes. The attacker generates billions of possible passwords, calculates the hash of them, and hopes that he finds the correct hash (and thus the corresponding password). If the software uses a fast hash function (such as `md5` or `sha256`) for the passwords, the hashes can be calculated very efficiently: Modern GPUs can calculate more than a million hashes per second. So an attacker can try through many passwords very quickly and may be able to **find a password for the corresponding hash after only a few seconds**.

This is simplified by the fact that many users have bad passwords that can be found in lists of common passwords (e.g., from previous password breaches on other platforms). Thus, an attacker first calculates the hashes of known passwords in his brute-force attack. These bad passwords are, therefore, cracked very quickly.

Example: The attacker tries to guess the password for the hash `482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38` and tries common passwords first:

```
admin        --->  21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3 (not correct)
test123      --->  cc03e747a6afbbcbf8be7668acfebee5 (not correct)
password123  --->  482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38 (correct password was found)
```

The next problem is that all users who have the same password also have the same password hash. If an attacker finds the password to a hash, he **knows the password for all users with this password hash**.

To prevent this, the hashing algorithm must be used in a way such that different users who have the same password do not get the same hash. For this purpose, a random string (called `salt`) that is different for each user is added to the password before it is hashed (see next section on how to fix the vulnerability).

If the attacker managed to find out some passwords, he can then use the list of passwords in various ways.
First, the attacker can **log in to the software as the corresponding user** and thus cause damage or access the user's personal data.
Second, since many users use the same password across multiple services, the attacker may also **gain access to the user's accounts on other websites**.
Third, the attacker can **sell or publish the list of usernames/emails and passwords**, allowing others to gain access to the accounts.
