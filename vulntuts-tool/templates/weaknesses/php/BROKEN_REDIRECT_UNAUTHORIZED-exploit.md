Let's assume a website has an administration interface that is accessible at `https://www.example.com/admin.php`.

The code in `admin.php` checks if the user is logged in. If this is not the case, the user will be redirected to the login page. This is accomplished by sending the HTTP header `Location` that signals the browser to load another page. 

<pre class="language-php line-numbers"><code>
&lt;?php
// if the user is not logged in
if (!isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) {
    // redirect user to http://www.example.com/login.php
    header("Location: http://www.example.com/login.php");
}

// remaining code of the page
foobar();
?>

Some text that should only be sent to users who are logged in.
</code></pre>

After sending the `Location` header, however, the rest of the code would still be executed (`foobar();`) and the page content is also sent to the browser (`Some text that should only be sent to users who are logged in.`).
The user usually does not notice this, because the browser immediately loads the login page. However, an attacker receives the content from the server and can view it without any problems.

As a result, the attacker can **obtain sensitive information** that only logged-in users or an administrator should be able to see.
Also, the attacker may be able to **perform functions** that only an administrator should be able to perform (`foobar();`).
