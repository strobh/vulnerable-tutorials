Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) occurs when a web application accepts data from untrusted sources (e.g., user input from a form) and then sends this data to a browser without checking the content. More precisely, the untrusted data is printed as part of the page content when the page is accessed by a user.
This allows an attacker to inject JavaScript code into a page that is indirectly sent to the browser of all users when they visit the page. The malicious code is then executed in the client's browser.

**Reflected Cross-Site Scripting** is a subcategory of XSS where the user input is sent to the server (mostly as GET parameter) and directly included in the answer of the request. The data is not stored by the server (e.g., in a database).
An attacker must, therefore, somehow get a user to visit a web page with manipulated parameters. For example, a website controlled by the attacker could redirect to a manipulated URL, or an email could contain a manipulated link.

Example: A JSP that displays a message to the user that is sent to the server as GET parameter

<pre class="language-html line-numbers"><code>
&lt;p>${param.message}&lt;/p>
</code></pre>

Let's assume a user manipulates the URL parameter `message` to look like this:

<pre class="language-html line-numbers"><code>
Some message!&lt;script>alert("Malicious code");&lt;/script>
</code></pre>

The resulting HTML of the web page would look like this:

<pre class="language-html line-numbers"><code>
&lt;p>Some message!&lt;script>alert("Malicious code");&lt;/script>&lt;/p>
</code></pre>

The script tag is printed as it was entered by the user and, therefore, also recognized as HTML and executed by the browser.

The injected malicious code may, for example,

- access the browser's session cookies for the website, allowing the attacker to **log in as the user**,
- record user input (keylogger), allowing the attacker to **find out passwords, credit card numbers, or addresses**,
- **change the web page as desired** (e.g., redirecting payments in a shop to the attacker),
- or use the computing power of the browser to **mine bitcoins** or other cryptocurrencies.
