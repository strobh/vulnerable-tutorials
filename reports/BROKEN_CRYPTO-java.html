<p>The software uses an insecure/broken cryptographic algorithm:
well-known techniques exist to break the algorithm. An attacker may be
able to compromise whatever data has been protected/encrypted. (<a
href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html">CWE-327</a>)</p>
<h2 id="how-can-an-attacker-exploit-the-vulnerability">How Can an
Attacker Exploit the Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>If a software uses a cryptography algorithm that is considered
insecure or broken, this might allow an attacker to <strong>break the
algorithm and gain access to sensitive information</strong>.</p>
<p>The following overview offers only a selection of relevant attack
scenarios against cryptography algorithms and cannot provide detailed
information about all possible attacks. However, some detailed
explanations are linked in the list below.</p>
<h4 id="encryption-algorithms">Encryption algorithms</h4>
<p>There are several encryption algorithms or encryption modes that are
considered to be insecure or cryptographically broken.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>AES</code> encryption in <code>CBC</code> mode is considered
insecure under certain conditions. It may be susceptible to <a
href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/66086">bit-flipping
attacks</a>, which allow an attacker to manipulate bits of the decrypted
message in a targeted manner, and <a
href="https://robertheaton.com/2013/07/29/padding-oracle-attack/">padding
oracle attacks</a>, which allow an attacker to decrypt the message. In
general, <code>CBC</code> provides confidentiality, but no authenticity
or integrity (i.e., an attacker can manipulate the cipher text without
the receiver noticing it). The widespread consensus, therefore, is that
the use of <code>CBC</code> without a Message Authentication Code (MAC),
which provides authenticity and integrity, is undesirable.</li>
<li>The <code>ECB</code> encryption mode is considered to be insecure,
regardless of which encryption algorithm (such as <code>AES</code>) is
used. <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/20946">The same block
of plaintext always yields the same ciphertext</a>. This allows an
attacker to gain knowledge, e.g., about patterns in the data, or whether
the same message is sent again or another one.</li>
<li><code>RSA</code> encryption without a padding has the same problems
as the <code>ECB</code> mode: The same block of plaintext always yields
the same ciphertext, thus leaking sensitive information.</li>
<li><code>RSA</code> encryption with the <code>PKCS#1 v1.5</code>
padding is considered insecure as it is vulnerable to the <a
href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/12706">Bleichenbacherâ€™s
attack</a>. In this attack, the attacker sends a large number of
ciphertexts to be decrypted which are chosen adaptively. This allows the
attacker to gradually reveal information about an encrypted message, or
about the decryption key itself.</li>
<li>The <code>DES</code> encryption algorithm uses a relatively short
56-bit key size. <a href="https://crack.sh/">There are systems</a> that
are able to break a DES key within less than 24 hours by using a
brute-force attack.</li>
<li><code>Triple DES</code>/<code>3DES</code>/<code>TDES</code>/<code>TDEA</code>
is a more secure triple key version of DES. But even though it has a
larger key size, it is <a
href="https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2017/Update-to-Current-Use-and-Deprecation-of-TDEA">already
considered insecure</a> in the face of modern super-computing
power.</li>
<li>The <code>RC4</code>/<code>ARC4</code>/<code>ARCFOUR</code>
encryption algorithm is susceptible to a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4#Security">range of attacks</a>
and is, therefore, also insecure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another common mistake is the incorrect use of encryption
algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <code>initialization vector (IV)</code> for the
<code>CBC</code> encryption mode is always the same instead of randomly
generated, this might leak sensitive information to an attacker. First,
the same block of plaintext always yields the same ciphertext. Second,
if the beginning of two plaintexts are the same and they differ in the
middle, the attacker can find out at which point they differ and thus
possibly find out sensitive information as well. Third, if the attacker
is allowed to encrypt his own plaintexts, he may be able deduce the
value of low entropy plaintext blocks.</li>
<li>If the <code>encryption key</code> can be guessed easily, an
attacker may be able to figure out the key by trying potential
keys.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hashmessage-digest-algorithms">Hash/Message digest
algorithms</h4>
<p>The hash functions <code>sha1</code> and <code>md5</code> are
considered cryptographically broken. There are <strong>collision
attacks</strong> for both of these hash algorithms. This means that an
attacker is able to find two inputs whose hashes are the same. For
<code>md5</code>, the attack can find collisions within seconds which
makes <code>md5</code> completely unsuitable for further use.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-fix-the-vulnerability">How Can You Fix the
Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>General consensus is that you should never <a
href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/18198">roll your own
cryptography</a>, instead you should rely on known algorithms that have
been analyzed by hundreds of experts. Also, you should never implement
the algorithms yourself, but use well-tested libraries, since it is very
easy to make mistakes when implementing cryptographic algorithms.</p>
<p>The following overview offers only a selection of secure algorithms
and can cover only a small part of potential usage scenarios.</p>
<h4 id="encryption-algorithms-1">Encryption algorithms</h4>
<p>It is recommended to use a high-level cryptography library instead of
using low-level functions. This already relieves the developer of many
sources of errors, since most libraries have secure default settings.
Ideally you should, for example, not need to generate encryption keys or
random nonces/IVs yourself, as critical mistakes can already be made at
this stage.</p>
<p>There is a broad consensus to use only encryption algorithms that
provide message integrity and authenticity. That means, the receiver can
confirm that the message came from the stated sender (its authenticity)
and has not been changed (integrity). Examples are <code>AES</code>
encryption in <code>GCM</code> mode or <code>RSA</code> encryption with
<code>OAEP</code> padding.</p>
<p>The most recommended and well-tested library is <a
href="https://www.bouncycastle.org/documentation.html">Bouncy
Castle</a>.</p>
<p>Example: Using the pyca/cryptography library to encrypt and decrypt a
message</p>
<pre class="language-java line-numbers"><code>
import java.security.Security
import org.bouncycastle.jcajce.provider.BouncyCastleFipsProvider

public class Demo {
    public void static main(String args[])
    {
        Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleFipsProvider());

        // message to encrypt
        byte[] message = byte[10];

        SecretKey secKey = generateKey();
        Object[] gcmOutput = gcmEncrypt(secKey, message);

        AlgorithmParameters gcmParameters = (AlgorithmParameters)gcmOutput[0];
        byte[] ciphertext = (byte[])gcmOutput[1];

        byte[] plaintext = gcmDecrypt(secKey, gcmParameters, ciphertext);
    }

    public static SecretKey generateKey()
        throws GeneralSecurityException
    {
        KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES", "BCFIPS");
        keyGenerator.init(256);
        return keyGenerator.generateKey();
    }

    public static Object[] gcmEncrypt(SecretKey key, byte[] data)
        throws GeneralSecurityException
    {
        final byte[] gcmNonceByte = new byte[12];
        SecureRandom secureRandomGcm = new SecureRandom();
        secureRandomGcm.nextBytes(gcmNonceByte);

        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding", "BCFIPS");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, new GCMParameterSpec(128, gcmNonceByte));
        return new Object[] { cipher.getParameters(), cipher.doFinal(data), };
    }

    public static byte[] gcmDecrypt(SecretKey key, AlgorithmParameters gcmParameters, byte[] cipherText)
        throws GeneralSecurityException
    {
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding", "BCFIPS");
        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key, gcmParameters);
        return cipher.doFinal(cipherText);
    }
}

<h4 id="hashmessage-digest-algorithms-1">Hash/Message digest
algorithms</h4>
<p>The most commonly used cryptographic hash function is
<code>SHA-256</code>.</p>
<p>A typical use of hash functions is to perform validation checks,
i.e., checking whether changes have been made to an object. If you want
to hash passwords instead, you should use special hash algorithms that
have been designed exactly for this use case such as <code>bcrypt</code>
or <code>argon2</code>.</p>
