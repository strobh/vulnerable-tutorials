<p>The software allows the attacker to upload files of dangerous types.
This allows an attacker to upload a script or application that is
executed by the server/software. (<a
href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html">CWE-434</a>)</p>
<h2 id="how-can-an-attacker-exploit-the-vulnerability">How Can an
Attacker Exploit the Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>If a server software offers the functionality to upload files, this
may provide attackers the ability to also upload malicious files to the
server if it does not validate the files.</p>
<p>A common variant is that the software saves the file to a folder
within the web document root (e.g., a folder named
<code>uploads</code>:</p>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers"><code>
import cgi, os
import cgitb
cgitb.enable()

form = cgi.FieldStorage()
fileitem = form['filename']

# check if the file has been uploaded
if fileitem.filename:
    # strip the leading path from the file name
    filename = os.path.basename(fileitem.filename)

    # write the file to the server
    open("uploads/" + filename, 'wb').write(fileitem.file.read())
</code></pre>
<p>If the file is not validated, the attacker can, for example, upload a
malicious executable script such as a PHP file (e.g.,
<code>malicious_file.php</code>). When this file is requested by a
browser from the web server (e.g., by opening
<code>www.example.org/uploads/malicious_file.php</code>), the web server
may execute this script. The attacker can thus <strong>inject and
execute arbitrary code</strong> that, for example, <strong>reads
arbitrary files on the server or connects to the database</strong>.</p>
<p>Another possible variant of the attack is that the attacker can use
the server to upload arbitrary files and then link to them, effectively
using the server as storage for large files or phishing pages.</p>
<p>If a <strong>path traversal attack</strong> is possible in addition
to the unrestricted file upload, the attacker can place the uploaded
file at a different path than the intended one. This could allow the
attacker to overwrite the Python code or other files on the server.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-fix-the-vulnerability">How Can You Fix the
Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>Each file that is uploaded to the server should be validated.</p>
<p>The software should not only check the file extension, but preferably
also the <strong>content or MIME type of the file</strong> (for example,
whether the file is a valid image if an image is to be uploaded), since
the file extension can be manipulated. Furthermore, the software should
also check the <strong>size of the file</strong>.</p>
<p>Ideally, the file should be given a randomly generated filename
instead of the original filename. This may also help to prevent a user
from accidentally overwriting an existing file. If the original file
name has to be used, it must be ensured that only <strong>valid
characters are contained in the file name</strong>. Otherwise, path
traversal attacks are possible that allow an attacker to place the file
at a different path than the intended one.</p>
<p>To fix the example from the previous section using the
<code>magic</code> library:</p>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers"><code>
import cgi, os
import cgitb
cgitb.enable()
import magic

form = cgi.FieldStorage()
fileitem = form['filename']

# check if the file has been uploaded
if fileitem.filename:
    # strip the leading path from the file name
    filename = os.path.basename(fileitem.filename)

    if magic.from_buffer(fileitem.file.read(), mime=True) != 'image/jpeg':
        print("The file must be a jpeg.")
    else:
        # write the file to the server
        open("uploads/" + filename, 'wb').write(fileitem.file.read())
</code></pre>
</main>
