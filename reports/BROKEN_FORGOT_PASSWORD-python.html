<p>The software contains a mechanism for users to recover or change
their passwords if they forgot the original password, but the mechanism
is weak. This allows an attacker to change the password of another user
and gain access to that user’s account. (<a
href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/640.html">CWE-640</a>)</p>
<h2 id="how-can-an-attacker-exploit-the-vulnerability">How Can an
Attacker Exploit the Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>If the software contains a mechanism for users to recover or change
their passwords that is weak/insecure, this may allow an attacker to
<strong>change the password of another user and gain access to that
user’s account</strong>.</p>
<p>Typically, the <code>forgot password</code> mechanism works as
follows: First, a user enters his e-mail address with which he
registered on the website. In order to verify that the user who wants to
change the password is really the user he claims to be, a random code is
sent to the email address. The assumption for this is that only the real
user should have access to the email account. The user must enter the
code from the email on the website or click on a link that contains this
code as URL parameter. Finally, the server validates the code and lets
the user set a new password.</p>
<p>There are a few ways in which this mechanism can be implemented
weakly:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the code sent in the email is easy to guess or is calculated
using a deterministic algorithm, the attacker can guess or calculate the
code without needing access to the email account of the user.</li>
<li>An attacker may be allowed to try many different codes on the server
until he finds the correct one.</li>
<li>If the software uses weak recovery questions to verify the user’s
identity, an attacker may be able to guess the correct answer and reset
the password.</li>
<li>If the software automatically generates a new password and sends it
by email, an email server may be able to read the content of the email
on the way to the recipient since emails are not encrypted.</li>
<li>If the software immediately blocks access to the account, e.g.,
because the password is changed, an attacker can lock out the real user,
as he will no longer be able to log into his account with the original
password.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-can-you-fix-the-vulnerability">How Can You Fix the

<p>The preferred way is to implement the <code>forgot password</code>
mechanism as explained in the previous section.</p>
<p>The following short guidelines can be used as a quick reference to
protect the forgot password service (source: <a
href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Forgot_Password_Cheat_Sheet.html">OWASP
Cheat Sheet Series</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Return a consistent message for both existent and non-existent
accounts.</li>
<li>Use a side-channel (e.g., emails) to communicate the method to reset
the password.</li>
<li>Use URL tokens for the simplest and fastest implementation.</li>
<li>Ensure that generated tokens or codes are:
<ul>
<li>Randomly generated using a cryptographically safe algorithm.</li>
<li>Sufficiently long to protect against brute-force attacks.</li>
<li>Stored securely.</li>
<li>Single use and expire after an appropriate period.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do not make a change to the account until a valid token is
presented, such as locking out the account.</li>
</ul>
