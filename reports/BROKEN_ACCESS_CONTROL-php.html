<p>Unauthorized users can access a resource/page or perform actions they
should not be allowed to access or perform. For example, a user can view
the administration interface without logging in or view other areas that
only logged-in users should be able to see. (<a
href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html">CWE-284</a>)</p>
<h2 id="how-can-an-attacker-exploit-the-vulnerability">How Can an
Attacker Exploit the Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>Let’s assume a website has an administration interface that is
accessible at <code>https://www.example.com/admin.php</code>. An
attacker could guess this URL without knowing the URL beforehand or he
could find a link to the admin page on the website. Then the attacker
could open the URL of the admin interface in the browser. If the server
does not verify whether the user is really logged in and is the
administrator, the attacker may <strong>gain access to sensitive
information</strong>, <strong>cause damage</strong>, or <strong>be able
to take over the website</strong>.</p>
<p>Another example is editing a post in a forum. The server should
always check whether the requesting user is logged in and if it is his
post that he wants to edit. Otherwise, an attacker could be able to edit
another user’s posts.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-fix-the-vulnerability">How Can You Fix the
Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>After a successful login, the server could store whether the user is
logged in, for example, by storing the user’s ID in the session:</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers"><code>
// login was successful
$_SESSION['user_id'] = $ID_OF_THE_USER;
</code></pre>
<p>On the page that should only be accessible by a logged-in user, the
server would then be able to check whether this variable is set:</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers" data-line="8"><code>
&lt;?php
// if the user is not logged in
if (!isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) {
    // redirect user to http://www.example.com/login.php
    header("Location: http://www.example.com/login.php");
    
    // very important! stop executing the code below
    exit;
}

// remaining code of the page
foobar(); // this code is not executed if the user is not logged in
?>

Some text that should only be sent to users who are logged in.
</code></pre>
<p>If the user is not logged in, he will be redirected to the login
page. This is accomplished by sending the HTTP header
<code>Location</code> that signals the browser to load another page.
After sending the <code>Location</code> header, however, the rest of the
code would still be executed (<code>foobar()</code>) and the page
content is also sent to the browser
(<code>Some text that should only be sent to users who are logged in.</code>).
The user usually does not notice this, because the browser immediately
loads the login page. However, an attacker receives the content from the
server and can view it without any problems.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very important that the <strong>execution of the
remaining code is stopped by terminating the script</strong> with
<code>exit;</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, note that the variable <code>$_SESSION['user_id']</code>
must be deleted when the user logs off:</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers"><code>
// after user has logged out:
unset($_SESSION['user_id']);
</code></pre>
