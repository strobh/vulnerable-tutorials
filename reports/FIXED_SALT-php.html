<p>The software generates a hash for a password that should not be
reversible, but the software uses a predictable salt as part of the
input. This makes it easier for an attacker to crack the password, e.g.,
by performing a brute-force attack. (<a
href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/760.html">CWE-760</a>)</p>
<h2 id="how-can-an-attacker-exploit-the-vulnerability">How Can an
Attacker Exploit the Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>If a software stores password hashes, there is a risk that an
attacker can gain access to them. This may be an employee or developer
who has access to the database and thus to all usernames and password
hashes. However, it may also be an external attacker who has gained
access to the database by hacking into the system.</p>
<p>An attacker who has gained access to the list of password hashes
typically uses a <strong>brute-force attack</strong> to crack the
password hashes. The attacker generates millions of possible passwords,
calculates the hashes of them, and hopes that he finds the correct hash
(and thus the corresponding password). This is simplified by the fact
that many users have bad passwords that can be found in lists of common
passwords (e.g., from previous password breaches on other platforms).
Thus, an attacker first calculates the hashes of known passwords in his
brute-force attack. These bad passwords are, therefore, cracked very
quickly.</p>
<p>Another problem is that all users who have the same password also
have the same password hash. If an attacker finds the password to a
hash, he <strong>knows the password for all users with this password
hash</strong>. Salts are hashed together with the password to prevent
this. However, if the same static salt is used for every user, the same
password results in the same password hash again. Thus, the attacker can
calculate hashes and guess passwords for all users at the same time.
<strong>Using a static instead of a random salt reduces the amount of
effort an attacker must spend to crack the password hashes
considerably.</strong></p>
<p>Example: The attacker tries to guess the password for the hash
<code>ed35b25ffc18b8960553f7d846f0fb90</code> with the static salt
<code>staticsalt</code> and tries common passwords first:</p>
<pre><code>admin       + staticsalt  ---&gt;  8b35ab95c9228d169430b1d8e8ae6b2b (not correct)
test123     + staticsalt  ---&gt;  dfd74a1e785b06658475108c20708f00 (not correct)
password123 + staticsalt  ---&gt;  ed35b25ffc18b8960553f7d846f0fb90 (correct password found)</code></pre>
<p>To prevent this, the hashing algorithm must be used in a way such
that <strong>different users who have the same password do not get the
same hash</strong>. For this purpose, a <strong>random</strong> string
(called <code>salt</code>) that is different for each user is added to
the password before it is hashed (see next section on how to fix the
vulnerability).</p>
<p>If the attacker managed to find out some passwords, he can then use
the list of passwords in various ways. First, the attacker can
<strong>log in to the software as the corresponding user</strong> and
thus cause damage or access the user’s personal data. Second, since many
users use the same password across multiple services, the attacker may
also <strong>gain access to the user’s accounts on other
websites</strong>. Third, the attacker can <strong>sell or publish the
list of usernames/emails and passwords</strong>, allowing others to gain
access to the accounts.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-fix-the-vulnerability">How Can You Fix the
Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>The objective is to prevent an attacker who has gained access to the
stored password hashes from being able to crack them (i.e., to find out
the corresponding passwords).</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers"><code>
// REGISTRATION: when the user creates an account
// ------------

// password entered by the user
$password = $_POST["password"];

// hash the password using bcrypt algorithm and store it in the database
$pw_hash = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);



// LOGIN: when the user logs in
// ------------

// password entered by the user
$password = $_POST["password"];

// load password hash from the database
$pw_hash = load_pw_from_database();

// verify that the correct password was entered
if (password_verify($password, $pw_hash)) {
    echo "correct password";
}
else {
    echo "incorrect password"
}
</code></pre>
<p>To prevent that all users who have the same password also have the
same password hash, the code snippet above <strong>generates a random
string</strong> (called <code>salt</code>) in
<code>password_hash()</code>. <strong>This salt is hashed together with
the password and is different for each user</strong>.</p>
<p>Example: Password hashes with salt (using the <code>bcrypt</code>
hash function)</p>
<pre><code>password123 + ddsYzDfKAH4F9fOYVh9Mve  ---&gt;  AVAlfghXiTW59Vbt74cpS.AMn.i5rte
password123 + 0Vl2RYbcb764tDaf44M2lO  ---&gt;  6aSZIA0a7mTrKunoYkAXEH/CGNKBbMa</code></pre>
<p>The same password (<code>password123</code>), but with different
salts (<code>ddsYzDfKAH4F9fOYVh9Mve</code> and
<code>0Vl2RYbcb764tDaf44M2lO</code>), results in different hashes. The
advantage is that an attacker can no longer try to calculate hashes for
all users at the same time. Instead, the attacker has to try passwords
for each salt (and thus each user) individually. For example,
<code>password123 + ddsYzDfKAH4F9fOYVh9Mve</code> and
<code>test123 + ddsYzDfKAH4F9fOYVh9Mve</code> for user A and
<code>password123 + 0Vl2RYbcb764tDaf44M2lO</code> and
<code>test123 + 0Vl2RYbcb764tDaf44M2lO</code> for user B. This
<strong>slows down the attacker and makes it practically impossible to
find out the passwords for all users</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: The salt must be stored in the database for each user
to be able to calculate the hash again later (e.g. when the user logs
in). If you use <code>password_hash()</code> the salt is included in the
password hash and you do not have to store it manually.</p>
