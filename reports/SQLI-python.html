<p>In an SQL injection attack, an attacker modifies an SQL query that is
executed by a database. The application constructs the SQL query using
user input, e.g., from an input field on the website, without
neutralizing special characters that modify the query. When the
malicious statement is successfully executed, the attacker can read
sensitive data from the database, modify data, or might even be able to
delete the complete database. (<a

<div class="warning">
<p>Warning: The code in this example is insecure because the password is
stored in clear text (i.e., the password is not hashed and no random
salt is used). This example is only to illustrate SQL injections and
should not be used for a login page.</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s assume a website has a login page where a user enters a
username and a password. The server then checks if the password is
correct and logs the user in:</p>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers" data-line="17"><code>
import mysql.connector

# connect to database
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='localhost',
    database='db_name',
    user='db_user',
    password='db_password'
)
cursor = connection.cursor()

# username and password entered by the user
username = "foo"
password = "bar"

# username and password are concatenated into the query
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'"
cursor.execute(query)
result = cursor.fetchone()

if result is None:
    print("wrong username or password")
else:
    print("successfully logged in")

cursor.close()
connection.close()
</code></pre>
<p>If the user enters <code>foo</code> as username and <code>bar</code>
as password, the resulting query is:</p>
<pre class="language-sql line-numbers"><code>
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'foo' AND password = 'bar'
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s assume an attacker enters the string “<code>admin' --</code>”
as username and <code>bar</code> as password. The resulting query
is:</p>
<pre class="language-sql line-numbers"><code>
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'admin' --' AND password = 'bar'
</code></pre>
<p>The apostrophe (<code>'</code>) in the username closes the string in
the SQL query that was started at <code>WHERE name = '</code>. The rest
of the username string (<code>--</code>) breaks out of the string value
and changes the query itself. The two dashes (<code>--</code>) then
signal the start of a comment in SQL. As a result, the remaining part of
the query is ignored:</p>
<pre class="language-sql line-numbers"><code>
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'admin'
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the database would return the row containing the
information about the user <code>admin</code> without checking whether
the password is correct. The attacker would then be logged in as the
user <code>admin</code>. If this is the administrator of the website,
the attacker could take over the website.</p>
<p>To sum up, the issue in the code example is that an attacker is able
to manipulate the query with his input.</p>
<p>SQL injections can also be used to <strong>read data from other
tables, modify data, or delete data</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-fix-the-vulnerability">How Can You Fix the
Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>The most secure and modern approach is to use <strong>prepared
statements</strong>.</p>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers" data-line="17-19"><code>
import mysql.connector

# connect to database
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='localhost',
    database='db_name',
    user='db_user',
    password='db_password'
)
cursor = connection.cursor(prepared=True)

# username and password entered by the user
username = "foo"
password = "bar"

# username and password are supplied separately to the prepared statement
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = %s AND password = %s"
params = (username, password)
cursor.execute(query, params)
result = cursor.fetchone()

if result == None:
    print("wrong username or password")
else:
    print("successfully logged in")

cursor.close()
connection.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Prepared statements make a strict distinction between the query and
the data to be used in the query. In the query, <code>%s</code> marks
where the data should be inserted later. Afterwards, we supply the
values as second parameter (as tuple) to the method
<code>cursor.execute()</code>. The database takes care that the data is
always interpreted as data only. Manipulation of the query is thus no
longer possible.</p>
