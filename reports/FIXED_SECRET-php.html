<p>The software uses hard-coded credentials, such as a password or a OTP
secret, to authenticate users. The hard-coded credentials are the same
for every user and every installation of the software. If an attacker
knows the hard-coded credentials from his own account or another
installation of the software, he can bypass the authentication. This may
allow an attacker to log in as administrator or as another user. (<a
href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html">CWE-798</a>)</p>
<h2 id="how-can-an-attacker-exploit-the-vulnerability">How Can an
Attacker Exploit the Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) are used as second
authentication factor in a number of two-factor authentication (2FA)
systems. For this purpose, an OTP code is calculated on the basis of an
OTP secret. The user has to enter the correct OTP code to be able to log
in.</p>
<p>If the OTP secret is hard-coded into the software, an attacker may be
able to find it out. The attacker is then able to calculate the correct
OTP code based on the hard-coded OTP secret. As a result, he only needs
to figure out the first factor (usually the password) to log in.
<strong>Using a hard-coded OTP secret</strong> rather than a random one
for each user completely <strong>eliminates the security benefit that a
correctly implemented two-factor authentication would have.</strong></p>
<p>There are different ways how an attacker can obtain the OTP secret
and calculate the OTP code:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the OTP secret is hard-coded into the application, it is the same
for every user. As a result, the OTP code that must be entered to log in
is also the same for every user. An attacker who has an account has the
same OTP code as all other user.</li>
<li>If the source code is publicly available (e.g., on GitHub or as
software download), an attacker can find the OTP secret in the source
code and calculate the OTP code.</li>
<li>If there are several installations of the software (i.e., the
software is used by several people/organizations), the OTP secret is the
same for each installation. A user who knows the OTP secret of one
installation also knows the OTP secret of the other installation (of
another organization) and can calculate the OTP code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-can-you-fix-the-vulnerability">How Can You Fix the
Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>The OTP secret should be generated randomly for each user and saved
in the database:</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers"><code>
$auth = new \Sonata\GoogleAuthenticator\GoogleAuthenticator();

$username = "..."; // username
$issuer = "..."; // name of the website/issueer
$secret = $auth->generateSecret();

$url = $auth->getURL($username, $issuer, $secret);

// TODO: save secret to database
</code></pre>
