<p>The software generates a hash for a password using a hashing scheme
that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort. This
makes it easier for an attacker to crack the password, e.g., by
performing a brute-force attack. (<a
href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/916.html">CWE-916</a>)</p>
<h2 id="how-can-an-attacker-exploit-the-vulnerability">How Can an
Attacker Exploit the Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>If a software stores password hashes, there is a risk that an
attacker can gain access to them. This may be an employee or developer
who has access to the database and thus to all usernames and password
hashes. However, it may also be an external attacker who has gained
access to the database by hacking into the system.</p>
<p>An attacker who has gained access to the list of password hashes
typically uses a <strong>brute-force attack</strong> to crack the
password hashes. The attacker generates billions of possible passwords,
calculates the hash of them, and hopes that he finds the correct hash
(and thus the corresponding password). If the software uses a fast hash
function (such as <code>md5</code> or <code>sha256</code>) for the
passwords, the hashes can be calculated very efficiently: Modern GPUs
can calculate more than a million hashes per second. So an attacker can
try through many passwords very quickly and may be able to <strong>find
a password for the corresponding hash after only a few
seconds</strong>.</p>
<p>This is simplified by the fact that many users have bad passwords
that can be found in lists of common passwords (e.g., from previous
password breaches on other platforms). Thus, an attacker first
calculates the hashes of known passwords in his brute-force attack.
These bad passwords are, therefore, cracked very quickly.</p>
<p>Example: The attacker tries to guess the password for the hash
<code>482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38</code> and tries common passwords
first:</p>
<pre><code>admin        ---&gt;  21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3 (not correct)
test123      ---&gt;  cc03e747a6afbbcbf8be7668acfebee5 (not correct)
password123  ---&gt;  482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38 (correct password was found)</code></pre>
<p>The next problem is that all users who have the same password also
have the same password hash. If an attacker finds the password to a
hash, he <strong>knows the password for all users with this password
hash</strong>.</p>
<p>To prevent this, the hashing algorithm must be used in a way such
that different users who have the same password do not get the same
hash. For this purpose, a random string (called <code>salt</code>) that
is different for each user is added to the password before it is hashed
(see next section on how to fix the vulnerability).</p>
<p>If the attacker managed to find out some passwords, he can then use
the list of passwords in various ways. First, the attacker can
<strong>log in to the software as the corresponding user</strong> and
thus cause damage or access the user’s personal data. Second, since many
users use the same password across multiple services, the attacker may
also <strong>gain access to the user’s accounts on other
websites</strong>. Third, the attacker can <strong>sell or publish the
list of usernames/emails and passwords</strong>, allowing others to gain
access to the accounts.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-fix-the-vulnerability">How Can You Fix the
Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>The objective is to prevent an attacker who has gained access to the
stored password hashes from being able to crack them (i.e., to find out
the corresponding passwords).</p>
<p>To prevent the efficient calculation of password hashes (brute-force
attack), you should only use <strong>hash functions designed for hashing
passwords, such as </strong>PBKDF2, bcrypt, or argon2<strong>. The
calculation of these hash algorithms requires a certain amount of
computational effort, which </strong>slows down the calculation
considerably** (e.g., to only 5 password hashes per second) and makes it
harder to try billions of passwords:</p>
<pre class="language-java line-numbers"><code>
// REGISTRATION: when the user creates an account
// ------------

// password entered by the user
String password = "...";

// generate salt
SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
byte[] salt = new byte[16];
random.nextBytes(salt);

// hash the password using PBKDF2 algorithm and store it in the database
KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, 65536, 24 * 8);
SecretKeyFactory f = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1");
byte[] hash = f.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
Base64.Encoder encoder = Base64.getEncoder();
String pw_salt = enc.encodeToString(salt);
String pw_hash = enc.encodeToString(hash);



// LOGIN: when the user logs in
// ------------

// password entered by the user
String password = "...";

// load password hash from the database
String pw_hash = load_pw_from_database();
String pw_salt = load_salt_from_database();
byte[] hash = Base64.getUrlDecoder().decode(pw_hash);
byte[] salt = Base64.getUrlDecoder().decode(pw_salt);

// calculate the hash of the password
KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, 65536, 24 * 8);
SecretKeyFactory f = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1");
byte[] check_hash = f.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();

// verify that the correct password was entered
int zero = 0;
for (int idx = 0; idx < check_hash.length; ++idx) {
    zero |= hash[salt.length + idx] ^ check_hash[idx];
}

if (zero == 0) {
    System.out.println("correct password");
}
else {
    System.out.println("incorrect password");
}
</code></pre>
<p>To prevent that all users who have the same password also have the
same password hash, the code snippet above <strong>generates a random
string</strong> (called <code>salt</code>) using
<code>random.nextBytes()</code>. This salt is <strong>hashed together
with the password</strong> and is different for each user.</p>
<p>Example: Password hashes with salt (using the <code>bcrypt</code>
hash function)</p>
<pre><code>password123 + ddsYzDfKAH4F9fOYVh9Mve  ---&gt;  AVAlfghXiTW59Vbt74cpS.AMn.i5rte
password123 + 0Vl2RYbcb764tDaf44M2lO  ---&gt;  6aSZIA0a7mTrKunoYkAXEH/CGNKBbMa</code></pre>
<p>The same password (<code>password123</code>), but with different
salts (<code>ddsYzDfKAH4F9fOYVh9Mve</code> and
<code>0Vl2RYbcb764tDaf44M2lO</code>), results in different hashes. The
advantage is that an attacker can no longer try to calculate hashes for
all users at the same time. Instead, the attacker has to try passwords
for each salt (and thus each user) individually. For example,
<code>password123+saltA</code> and <code>test123+saltA</code> for user A
and <code>password123+saltB</code> and <code>test123+saltB</code> for
user B. This <strong>slows down the attacker even more and makes it
practically impossible to find out the passwords for all
users</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: The salt must be stored in the database for each user
to be able to calculate the hash again later (e.g. when the user logs
in).</p>
