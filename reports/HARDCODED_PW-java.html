<p>The software uses hard-coded credentials, such as a password or a
cryptographic key, to authenticate users or to encrypt data. This
hard-coded credentials are the same for each installation of the
software, and they usually cannot be changed without manually modifying
the program. If the password is ever discovered or published (e.g., in
the source code on GitHub), then anybody with knowledge of this password
can access the product. (<a
href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html">CWE-798</a>)</p>
<h2 id="how-can-an-attacker-exploit-the-vulnerability">How Can an
Attacker Exploit the Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>If the username and password to log into an application are
hard-coded into the software, there is a risk that an attacker may gain
access to these credentials. The attacker would then be able to log into
the software and cause damage.</p>
<p>There are many ways an attacker can obtain hard-coded
credentials:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the source code is publicly available (e.g., on GitHub or as
software download), an attacker can find the username and password in
the source code and log into the application.</li>
<li>If the software has been compiled and published (e.g. as iOS app,
Android app, or <code>jar</code> file for Java applications), an
attacker can decompile the software and find the credentials in it.</li>
<li>If there are several installations of the software (i.e., the
software is used by several people/organizations), the password is the
same for each installation. A user who knows the password of one
installation can also log in to another installation (of another
organization). This problem also exists with default passwords that are
the same in every installation.</li>
<li>The password is known to employees or software developers who
disclose it to an attacker.</li>
<li>And many more …</li>
</ul>

Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>Instead of hard-coded credentials, the application could have a
“first login” mode where no credentials are required. When logging in
for the first time, the <strong>user is required to enter a strong
password that is stored on the system</strong>.</p>
<p>The password should be hashed with a cryptographic hash function and
stored in a database or a configuration file. A cryptographic hash
function is an algorithm that maps data (e.g., a password) to fixed-size
values (called “hash”). It is a one-way function. That means it is
<strong>not possible to invert or reverse</strong> the computation:
Given a password you can easily calculate the hash, but you cannot
calculate the password if you only know the hash of it.</p>
<pre><code>Password  ---&gt;  Hash
Hash      -/-&gt;  Password (not possible)</code></pre>
<p>Example: Password hashes (using the insecure <code>md5</code> hash
function)</p>
<pre><code>password123   ---&gt;  482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38
password1234  ---&gt;  bdc87b9c894da5168059e00ebffb9077</code></pre>
<p>An attacker looking for the password to a hash has no choice but to
use a <strong>brute-force attack</strong> to crack the password hashes.
The attacker generates billions of possible passwords, calculates the
hashes of them, and hopes that he finds the correct hash (and thus the
corresponding password). That is why it is very important that the hash
function is not too easy to compute. If the software uses a fast hash
function (such as <code>md5</code> or <code>sha256</code>) for the
passwords, the hashes can be calculated very efficiently: Modern GPUs
can calculate more than a million hashes per second. So an attacker can
try through many passwords very quickly and may be able to <strong>find
a password for the corresponding hash after only a few
seconds</strong>.</p>
<p>This is simplified by the fact that many users have bad passwords
that can be found in lists of common passwords (e.g., from previous
password breaches on other platforms). Thus, an attacker first
calculates the hashes of known passwords in his brute-force attack.
These bad passwords are, therefore, cracked very quickly.</p>
<p>For this reason, you should only use <strong>hash functions designed
for hashing passwords, such as bcrypt or argon2</strong>. The
calculation of these hash algorithms requires a certain amount of
computational effort, which <strong>slows down the calculation
considerably</strong> (e.g., to only 5 password hashes per second) and
makes it harder to try billions of passwords:</p>
<pre class="language-java line-numbers"><code>
// REGISTRATION: when the user creates an account
// ------------

// password entered by the user
String password = "...";

// generate salt
SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
byte[] salt = new byte[16];
random.nextBytes(salt);

// hash the password using PBKDF2 algorithm and store it in the database
KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, 65536, 24 * 8);
SecretKeyFactory f = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1");
byte[] hash = f.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
Base64.Encoder encoder = Base64.getEncoder();
String pw_salt = enc.encodeToString(salt);
String pw_hash = enc.encodeToString(hash);



// LOGIN: when the user logs in
// ------------

// password entered by the user
String password = "...";

// load password hash from the database
String pw_hash = load_pw_from_database();
String pw_salt = load_salt_from_database();
byte[] hash = Base64.getUrlDecoder().decode(pw_hash);
byte[] salt = Base64.getUrlDecoder().decode(pw_salt);

// calculate the hash of the password
KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, 65536, 24 * 8);
SecretKeyFactory f = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1");
byte[] check_hash = f.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();

// verify that the correct password was entered
int zero = 0;
for (int idx = 0; idx < check_hash.length; ++idx) {
    zero |= hash[salt.length + idx] ^ check_hash[idx];
}

if (zero == 0) {
    System.out.println("correct password");
}
else {
    System.out.println("incorrect password");
}
</code></pre>
<p>The next problem is that all users who have the same password also
have the same password hash. If an attacker finds the password to a
hash, he <strong>knows the password for all users with this password
hash</strong>.</p>
<p>To prevent this, the code snippet above <strong>generates a random
string</strong> (called <code>salt</code>) using
<code>random.nextBytes()</code> <strong>that is hashed together with the
password</strong> and that is different for each user.</p>
<p>Example: Password hashes with salt (using the <code>bcrypt</code>
hash function)</p>
<pre><code>password123 + ddsYzDfKAH4F9fOYVh9Mve  ---&gt;  AVAlfghXiTW59Vbt74cpS.AMn.i5rte
password123 + 0Vl2RYbcb764tDaf44M2lO  ---&gt;  6aSZIA0a7mTrKunoYkAXEH/CGNKBbMa</code></pre>
<p>The same password (<code>password123</code>), but with different
salts (<code>ddsYzDfKAH4F9fOYVh9Mve</code> and
<code>0Vl2RYbcb764tDaf44M2lO</code>), results in different hashes. The
advantage is that an attacker can no longer try to calculate hashes for
all users at the same time. Instead, the attacker has to try passwords
for each salt (and thus each user) individually. For example,
<code>password123+saltA</code> and <code>test123+saltA</code> for user A
and <code>password123+saltB</code> and <code>test123+saltB</code> for
user B. This <strong>slows down the attacker even more and makes it
practically impossible to find out the passwords for all
users</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: The salt must be stored in the database for each user
to be able to calculate the hash again later (e.g. when the user logs
in).</p>
