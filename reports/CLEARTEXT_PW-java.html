<p>The software stores passwords or other sensitive information in
cleartext. If an attacker gains access to them, he can read and use all
passwords, possibly even for an administrator account. (<a
href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/312.html">CWE-312</a>)</p>
<h2 id="how-can-an-attacker-exploit-the-vulnerability">How Can an
Attacker Exploit the Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>If a software stores passwords in clear text, there is a risk that an
attacker can gain access to them. This may be an employee or developer
who has access to the database and thus to all usernames and passwords.
However, it may also be an external attacker who has gained access to
the database by hacking into the system.</p>
<p>The attacker can then use the compromised list of passwords in
various ways. First, the attacker can <strong>log in to the software as
the corresponding user</strong> and thus cause damage or access the
user’s personal data. Second, since many users use the same password
across multiple services, the attacker may also <strong>gain access to
the user’s accounts on other websites</strong>. Third, the attacker can
<strong>sell or publish the list of usernames/emails and
passwords</strong>, allowing others to gain access to the accounts.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-fix-the-vulnerability">How Can You Fix the
Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>The objective is to prevent an attacker who has gained access to the
stored passwords from being able to use them.</p>
<p><strong>Cryptographic hash functions</strong> solve this issue. A
cryptographic hash function is an algorithm that maps data (e.g., a
password) to fixed-size values (called “hash”). It is a one-way
function. That means it is <strong>not possible to invert or
reverse</strong> the computation: Given a password you can easily
calculate the hash, but you cannot calculate the password if you only
know the hash of it.</p>
<pre><code>Password  ---&gt;  Hash
Hash      -/-&gt;  Password (not possible)</code></pre>
<p>Example: Password hashes (using the insecure <code>md5</code> hash
function)</p>
<pre><code>password123   ---&gt;  482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38
password1234  ---&gt;  bdc87b9c894da5168059e00ebffb9077</code></pre>
<p>An attacker looking for the password to a hash has no choice but to
use a <strong>brute-force attack</strong> to crack the password hashes.
The attacker generates billions of possible passwords, calculates the
hashes of them, and hopes that he finds the correct hash (and thus the
corresponding password). That is why it is very important that the hash
function is not too easy to compute. If the software uses a fast hash
function (such as <code>md5</code> or <code>sha256</code>) for the
passwords, the hashes can be calculated very efficiently: Modern GPUs
can calculate more than a million hashes per second. So an attacker can
try through many passwords very quickly and may be able to <strong>find
a password for the corresponding hash after only a few
seconds</strong>.</p>
<p>This is simplified by the fact that many users have bad passwords
that can be found in lists of common passwords (e.g., from previous
password breaches on other platforms). Thus, an attacker first
calculates the hashes of known passwords in his brute-force attack.
These bad passwords are, therefore, cracked very quickly.</p>
<p>For this reason, you should only use <strong>hash functions designed
for hashing passwords, such as PBKDF2, bcrypt, or argon2</strong>. The
calculation of these hash algorithms requires a certain amount of
computational effort, which <strong>slows down the calculation
considerably</strong> (e.g., to only 5 password hashes per second) and
makes it harder to try billions of passwords:</p>
<pre class="language-java line-numbers"><code>
// REGISTRATION: when the user creates an account
// ------------

// password entered by the user
String password = "...";

// generate salt
SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
byte[] salt = new byte[16];
random.nextBytes(salt);

// hash the password using PBKDF2 algorithm and store it and the salt in the database
KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, 65536, 24 * 8);
SecretKeyFactory f = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1");
byte[] hash = f.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
Base64.Encoder encoder = Base64.getEncoder();

String pw_salt = enc.encodeToString(salt);
String pw_hash = enc.encodeToString(hash);



// LOGIN: when the user logs in
// ------------

// password entered by the user
String password = "...";

// load password hash from the database
String pw_hash = load_pw_from_database();
String pw_salt = load_salt_from_database();
byte[] hash = Base64.getUrlDecoder().decode(pw_hash);
byte[] salt = Base64.getUrlDecoder().decode(pw_salt);

// calculate the hash of the password
KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, 65536, 24 * 8);
SecretKeyFactory f = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1");
byte[] check_hash = f.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();

// verify that the correct password was entered
int zero = 0;
for (int idx = 0; idx < check_hash.length; ++idx) {
    zero |= hash[salt.length + idx] ^ check_hash[idx];
}

if (zero == 0) {
    System.out.println("correct password");
}
else {
    System.out.println("incorrect password");
}
</code></pre>
<p>The next problem is that all users who have the same password also
have the same password hash. If an attacker finds the password to a
hash, he <strong>knows the password for all users with this password
hash</strong>.</p>
<p>To prevent this, the code snippet above <strong>generates a random
string</strong> (called <code>salt</code>) using
<code>random.nextBytes()</code> <strong>that is hashed together with the
password</strong> and that is different for each user.</p>
<p>Example: Password hashes with salt (using the <code>bcrypt</code>
hash function)</p>
<pre><code>password123 + ddsYzDfKAH4F9fOYVh9Mve  ---&gt;  AVAlfghXiTW59Vbt74cpS.AMn.i5rte
password123 + 0Vl2RYbcb764tDaf44M2lO  ---&gt;  6aSZIA0a7mTrKunoYkAXEH/CGNKBbMa</code></pre>
<p>The same password (<code>password123</code>), but with different
salts (<code>ddsYzDfKAH4F9fOYVh9Mve</code> and
<code>0Vl2RYbcb764tDaf44M2lO</code>), results in different hashes. The
advantage is that an attacker can no longer try to calculate hashes for
all users at the same time. Instead, the attacker has to try passwords
for each salt (and thus each user) individually. For example,
<code>password123+saltA</code> and <code>test123+saltA</code> for user A
and <code>password123+saltB</code> and <code>test123+saltB</code> for
user B. This <strong>slows down the attacker even more and makes it
practically impossible to find out the passwords for all
users</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: The salt must be stored in the database for each user
to be able to calculate the hash again later (e.g. when the user logs
in).</p>
