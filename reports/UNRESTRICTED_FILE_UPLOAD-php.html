<p>The software allows the attacker to upload files of dangerous types.
This allows an attacker to upload a script or application that is
executed by the server/software. (<a
href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html">CWE-434</a>)</p>
<h2 id="how-can-an-attacker-exploit-the-vulnerability">How Can an
Attacker Exploit the Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>If a server software offers the functionality to upload files, this
may provide attackers the ability to also upload malicious files to the
server if it does not validate the files.</p>
<p>A common variant is that the software saves the file to a folder
within the web document root (e.g., a folder named
<code>uploads</code>:</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers"><code>
$target_dir = "uploads/";
$target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["file"]["name"]);

if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
    echo "The file ". htmlspecialchars(basename($_FILES["file"]["name"])). " has been uploaded.";
} else {
    echo "There was an error uploading your file.";
}
</code></pre>
<p>If the file is not validated, the attacker can, for example, upload a
malicious executable script such as a PHP file (e.g.,
<code>malicious_file.php</code>). When this file is requested by a
browser from the web server (e.g., by opening
<code>www.example.org/uploads/malicious_file.php</code>), the web server
executes this script. The attacker can thus <strong>inject and execute
arbitrary code</strong> that, for example, <strong>reads arbitrary files
on the server or connects to the database</strong>.</p>
<p>Another possible variant of the attack is that the attacker can use
the server to upload arbitrary files and then link to them, effectively
using the server as storage for large files or phishing pages.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-fix-the-vulnerability">How Can You Fix the
Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>Each file that is uploaded to the server should be validated.</p>
<p>The software should not only check the file extension, but preferably
also the <strong>content or MIME type of the file</strong> (for example,
whether the file is a valid image if an image is to be uploaded), since
the file extension can be manipulated. Furthermore, the software should
also check the <strong>size of the file</strong>.</p>
<p>Ideally, the file should be given a randomly generated filename
instead of the original filename. This may also help to prevent a user
from accidentally overwriting an existing file. If the original file
name has to be used, it must be ensured that only <strong>valid
characters are contained in the file name</strong>. Otherwise, path
traversal attacks are possible that allow an attacker to place the file
at a different path than the intended one.</p>
<p>To fix the example from the previous section:</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers"><code>
function upload_file() {
    $target_dir = "uploads/";
    $target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["file"]["name"]);

    $check = getimagesize($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"]);
    if ($check == false) {
        echo "The file is not an image.";
        return;
    }

    if (file_exists($target_file)) {
        echo "The file already exists.";
        return;
    }

    // check file size to be smaller than 10 MB
    if ($_FILES["file"]["size"] > 1024 * 1024 * 10) {
        echo "The file is too large.";
        return;
    }

    if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
        echo "The file ". htmlspecialchars(basename($_FILES["file"]["name"])). " has been uploaded.";
    } else {
        echo "There was an error uploading your file.";
    }
}
