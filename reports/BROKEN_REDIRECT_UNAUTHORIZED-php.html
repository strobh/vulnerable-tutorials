<p>Unauthorized users can access a resource/page or perform actions they
should not be allowed to access or perform. For example, a user can view
the administration interface without logging in or view other areas that
only logged-in users should be able to see. This is caused by the fact
that a user who is not logged in is redirected to another page, e.g.,
the login page. To redirect the user, a <code>Location</code> header is
sent. However, the content of the page that should be sent only to
logged-in users is also sent in the response and can be viewed by an
attacker. (<a
href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html">CWE-284</a>)</p>
<h2 id="how-can-an-attacker-exploit-the-vulnerability">How Can an
Attacker Exploit the Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>Letâ€™s assume a website has an administration interface that is
accessible at <code>https://www.example.com/admin.php</code>.</p>
<p>The code in <code>admin.php</code> checks if the user is logged in.
If this is not the case, the user will be redirected to the login page.
This is accomplished by sending the HTTP header <code>Location</code>
that signals the browser to load another page.</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers"><code>
&lt;?php
// if the user is not logged in
if (!isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) {
    // redirect user to http://www.example.com/login.php
    header("Location: http://www.example.com/login.php");
}

// remaining code of the page
foobar();
?>

Some text that should only be sent to users who are logged in.
</code></pre>
<p>After sending the <code>Location</code> header, however, the rest of
the code would still be executed (<code>foobar();</code>) and the page
content is also sent to the browser
(<code>Some text that should only be sent to users who are logged in.</code>).
The user usually does not notice this, because the browser immediately
loads the login page. However, an attacker receives the content from the
server and can view it without any problems.</p>
<p>As a result, the attacker can <strong>obtain sensitive
information</strong> that only logged-in users or an administrator
should be able to see. Also, the attacker may be able to <strong>perform
functions</strong> that only an administrator should be able to perform
(<code>foobar();</code>).</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-fix-the-vulnerability">How Can You Fix the
Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>The issue can be fixed by stopping the execution of the remaining PHP
script with <code>exit;</code> after sending the <code>Location</code>
header. This also stops any further content from being sent to the
browser.</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers" data-line="8"><code>
&lt;?php
// if the user is not logged in
if (!isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) {
    // redirect user to http://www.example.com/login.php
    header("Location: http://www.example.com/login.php");
    
    // very important! stop executing the code below
    exit;
}

// remaining code of the page
foobar(); // this code is not executed if the user is not logged in
?>

Some text that should only be sent to users who are logged in.
