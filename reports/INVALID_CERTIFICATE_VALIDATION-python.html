<p>The software does not validate or incorrectly validates a
certificate. This might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted server or
act as a man-in-the-middle by interfering in the communication path
between the host and client. The attacker might be able to intercept
sensitive data or send data that appear to originate from a trusted
server. (<a
href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html">CWE-295</a>)</p>
<h2 id="how-can-an-attacker-exploit-the-vulnerability">How Can an
Attacker Exploit the Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>When a client connects to a server over TLS (e.g. https), a TLS
handshake is performed. As part of the TLS handshake, the server sends a
message to the client containing the server’s TLS certificate. Then, the
client validates the certificate to ensure that the certificate can be
trusted (i.e., that the certificate is signed by a trusted certificate
authority) and that the certificate matches the domain the client is
interacting with. This process confirms that the server is who it claims
to be and that the client is interacting with the real owner of the
domain.</p>
<p>If the client does not validate the server’s TLS certificate, this
<strong>significantly increases the risk that the client will fall
victim to a Man in the Middle (MitM) attack</strong>. In this attack, an
attacker secretly reads, relays, and possibly modifies the
communications between the server and the client. The two parties
believe that they are directly communicating with each other, as the
attacker has inserted themselves in the connection between the two
parties.</p>
<p>A Man in the Middle attack poses a major security risk, as the
attacker can then, for example, <strong>harvest passwords or API keys,
manipulate the content of web pages viewed by the client</strong>, or,
in case of online banking, <strong>change the destination account number
and transfer amount of a transfer</strong>.</p>
<p>The TLS certificate validation is often disabled if a client should
connect to a server that uses an untrusted self-signed certificate for
which the validation fails.</p>
<p>In Python, the validation of TLS certificates is often disabled by
using the functions in the <code>requests</code> module with
<code>verify=False</code>:</p>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers" data-line="4"><code>
import requests

url = "https://example.org"
result = requests.get(url, verify=False)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="how-can-you-fix-the-vulnerability">How Can You Fix the
Vulnerability?</h2>
<p>Most libraries already validate TLS certificates by default unless
validation is manually disabled by the developer. Therefore, the
<strong>validation should never be disabled manually</strong>.</p>
<p>If the TLS certificate validation fails due to a self-signed
certificate, the self-signed certificate should be added to the host’s
trusted certificates for the validation to succeed. It is then no longer
necessary to disable the TLS certificate validation.</p>
<p>To fix the example from the previous section, set the
<code>verify</code> parameter to <code>True</code> or omit it, as this
is the default value:</p>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers" data-line="4"><code>
import requests

url = "https://example.org"
result = requests.get(url, verify=True)
</code></pre>
